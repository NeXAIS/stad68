Suggestions and constructive criticism are encouraged throughout the course and may be particularly valuable early in the semester. To that end, we may use surveys and/or reflection assignments to gather input on what is working well and what could be improved. You will also be asked to complete an end-of-semester, online Student Survey of Teaching, which could inform modifications to this course (and other courses that I teach) in the future.


## Attendance Policy
